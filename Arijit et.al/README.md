As part of our Graph Mining assignment, we implement the ’Correct and Smooth’ procedure as introduced in the paper ’COMBINING LABEL PROPAGATION AND SIMPLE MODELS OUT-PERFORMS GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK’ by Huang et al. for transductive node classification tasks. For experiments, we use the Cora, Citeseer, US County datasets (also used in the original paper) which have node features as well as edges between nodes. Our implementation is seen to perform better than the original paper’s implementation for the Cora and Citeseer datasets and perform almost similar for the US county dataset. Through our results we also demonstrate that base model performance improves when we introduce graph awareness using label propagation.
